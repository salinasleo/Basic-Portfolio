        <div class="profile">Welcome to my website, it is a work in progress. I am learning web development via a coding bootcamp at the 
            University of Richmond. My son wants me to make videogames for him, and I've always had website ideas but don't know how 
            to execute them, so I figure a coding bootcamp wouldn't hurt. I have created a e-commerce website for a business I started last year, 
            I built it using Volusion.com, I intend to copy it locally and build on it.
            For my dayjob I do a lot of analytics for SunTrust Banks, where I have been able to analyze and summarize our loan performance, 
            default operations, fraud operations, etc.
            I am a former competitive swimmer, I represented my home county of Mexico at the highest levels.
